# How to start project

First you have to setup your local environment. Create file `.env` in root directory and fill it with your data. You can use `.env.sample` as example.

Inside .env set this variables:
```
REACT_APP_HACKER_CLIENT=http://localhost:3000
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

### `yarn start`
